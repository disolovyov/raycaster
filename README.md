# raycaster

This is a software raycaster based on [Lode's raycasting tutorials](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/index.html).

It exists for me to play around with Rust [game dev libraries](https://arewegameyet.com/). :)

## Running

To build and run:

```
cargo run --release
```

## Credits

- Textures and sprites by [mutantleg](https://mutantleg.itch.io/)
